# The Pyarrow package was added because of the following DeprecationWarning:
#   Pyarrow will become a required dependency of pandas in the next major release of pandas (pandas 3.0),
#   (to allow more performant data types, such as the Arrow string type, and better interoperability with other libraries)
#   but was not found to be installed on your system.
