for macs2 use hela-s3-polar2a-hg38.bed and transform it to BAM
then use macs2 to make a peak calling 
then repeat this step using subprocess in python
then connect it to the round2 program

run example of bedtools:

bedtools intersect -a hg19_mir688.bed -b hg19_mir688.bed



TODO new:
1. try to show in live the pygenometracks script 
2. create a backend pipline for extracting genes from genome positions (or cpg ids)
	a. link the script that extract bed from cpg 
	b. bedintersect a gene bed data 
	c. extract gene as list (sub process of cut)
3. identify cpg sites with specific TF motif and intersect them with a chip-seq data
