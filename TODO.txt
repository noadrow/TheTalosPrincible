for macs2 use hela-s3-polar2a-hg38.bed and transform it to BAM
then use macs2 to make a peak calling 
then repeat this step using subprocess in python
then connect it to the round2 program

run example of bedtools:

bedtools intersect -a hg19_mir688.bed -b hg19_mir688.bed



todo (pending to be approval)
- more readable data layout
- peak calling, more specifically:
     - reducing the currently long pipeline into a single button   <----    we would be stating here
     - buttons and sliders for choosing criteria
- showing intersections graphs
- init project page in github and creating issues
